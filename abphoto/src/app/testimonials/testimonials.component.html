    <span class="testimonial__title ">Alex and his wife were amazing for my son's senior pictures!
        He was really nervous as he's never done a photo shoot before but they were very calming and we got a ton of really great pictures.
        I will definitely use them again and highly recommend them!</span>

    <span class="testimonial__title ">Alex was rapid with response times from the very beginning, and overall was easy to communicate with. 
        When it was time for the shoot, my daughter was very shy, but Alex was incredibly patient and went out of his way to try to help/guide her through it. 
        The end result was great photos that we were all happy with. I would definitely recommend!</span>

    <span class="testimonial__title">Worked with Monkifoto on a professional photo shoot for our non profit organization. He was a professional and took some great photos.
         He was also very helpful in providing the copies of the photos again after I formatted my hard drive. I would definitely recommend this business</span>
